Updates to the venerable MIT Shakespeare html texts

This repo is intended to make available new, improved versions of the HTML text files that are freely available for download at http://shakespeare.mit.edu/

Files available here will be modernized versions, having been cleaned up with a tool such as:

Any other, small fixes will be listed in individual commits.

Disclaimer: We have no relationship with MIT or with The Tech, MIT's newspaper that hosts the MIT Shakespeare site. But we've been working with the texts of a couple of the plays, using them for a digital analysis project for a client. Since we found we had to update them and correct a few defects for our own purposes, we wanted to share that work back with the community. We've been unable to raise the original developer, Jeremy Hylton, to see if he wanted to incorporate these changes back into the MIT collection. So we decided to put them here for the time being. If anyone with a more official relationship to the MIT project wants to adopt our changes, great. Meantime, they are here for anyone else who can find/use them.
